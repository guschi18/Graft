- BuildOptions · interface · L54-L64 — Defines options for customizing the build process, including output directory and model settings.
- BuildResult · interface · L66-L75 — Holds the results of the build process, including counts of files and nodes processed.
- BuildCache · interface · L78-L81 — Stores cached summaries and synthesized nodes to optimize the build process.
- FileWork · interface · L83-L87 — Represents the work done on each file during the build process, including its summary and hash.
- NodeDraft · interface · L90-L97 — Represents a node being constructed before finalizing its properties and links.
- buildContext · function · L99-L266 — Main function that orchestrates the building of the context graph from the source files.
- batchBySize · function · L269-L285 — Groups file summaries into batches that fit within a specified character budget for processing.
