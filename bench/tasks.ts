/**
 * The benchmark corpus and task set. This file *is* the benchmark's validity:
 * every task must have a verifiable answer, grounded in the actual source
 * (cited during authoring), not guessed. Tasks carry a `locality` label so the
 * report can split the verdict: multi-file questions are where graph context
 * should help; localized single-file questions are where it is expected to be
 * net overhead — the bench must measure both, not select for the winner.
 *
 * Corpora: graft's own repo (context-engine — always present, self-contained),
 * plus real external repos expected as siblings of this one under the same
 * parent directory (override a path with BENCH_REPO_<ID_UPPER> if needed):
 *   - unified-accounts-login-server — the Nanonets unified auth service (Node/Express).
 *   - new-website — the Nanonets marketing site (Next.js App Router).
 * Plus the checked-in demo docs (northwind-docs) as a knowledge-folder data
 * point (currently skipped: the wiring graph indexes code only).
 *
 * Note on fairness: the wiring graph indexes only code files tree-sitter can
 * parse, so README/markdown/package.json/CSS do NOT enter the graph — while
 * the cold agent can read them. Code questions therefore target *code*
 * understanding, not README/config lookups.
