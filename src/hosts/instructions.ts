This repo is indexed in \`graft/\`: small linked markdown nodes that explain each
system and carry exact file:line spans, kept in sync with the code through git.

For ANY task here — understanding how something works, finding where code lives,
or scoping a change — get context from the graph before grepping or opening
source files:

- Run \`graft ask "<your question>" --source\` → ranked nodes with the relevant
  code spans inlined. The node usually IS the answer; stop there.
- Or browse: \`graft/INDEX.md\` lists every node; follow the links.

Only open source files when a node genuinely lacks a needed detail, and then at
the exact file:line the node points to — never re-read whole files.

After big code changes, refresh the graph with \`graft build\` (deterministic,
no API key, $0).`;
