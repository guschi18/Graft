# graft

This repo's code is summarised in \`graft/\` — small markdown nodes, each
explaining one part in plain prose and naming the exact files and line-spans it
covers. Reading a node costs a few hundred tokens; reading source to rebuild the
same understanding costs thousands.

**Get context from graft first — two ways, both land here:**

- Ask: \`graft ask "<your task, in plain words>"\` — returns the relevant nodes,
  ranked, with file:line pointers. Add \`--source\` to inline the actual code at
  each span, so the result IS the code you need — no separate file read. By
  default \`--source\` inlines each hit's crux (the ≤8-line core of the
  definition, marked as such); add \`--full\` only when the crux isn't enough.
  Ask is cheap (<1s) — re-ask with different phrasings for each sub-question,
  and use structural forms too: \`graft ask "who calls <symbol>"\`.
- Skim a file's API without reading it: \`graft skeleton <file>\` — every
  definition's signature + span in ~200 tokens, ~10× cheaper than the file.
- Or explore as usual: grep / ls / cat inside \`graft/\`. A grep for any concept,
  symbol, or filename hits the node that covers it; \`graft/INDEX.md\` lists them
  all.

**Match the tool to the task shape:**

- **Understanding, explaining, locating where a change goes** — the node IS the
  answer. Cite files and functions straight from its \`covers:\` list — it gives
  the exact \`file:line\` for every symbol, so you can cite precisely without
  opening the source. The spans are generated from that source and are
  authoritative; don't re-open files just to "double-check" them.
- **Editing:** run \`graft ask "<symbol>" --source\` to pull the exact span's
  code inline, and edit straight from that. Touch the file only to apply the
  change at the named \`file:line\` — never read the whole file to get oriented;
  the pack already oriented you.
- **Exhaustive tasks — "every occurrence / every provider / every caller of
  this pattern":** ranked results are top-N, not a complete list. Use graft to
  orient (what is the pattern, where does it live), then ENUMERATE with grep
  over the source and verify each hit. Ask alone will miss instances; that is
  expected, not a graft failure.

**Precise graph modes** — for structural questions, skip ranking and go
straight to precomputed edges:

- \`graft callers <symbol>\` / \`graft callees <symbol>\` — who breaks if this
  changes / what does this call — precomputed edges, exact answers; structural
  phrasing inside ask ("who calls X") routes here too.
- \`graft impact <symbol> [-d N]\` — BFS over incoming edges out to depth N: the
  full blast radius of a change.

If a returned span is truncated ("+N more lines"), open the file at that exact
range before finalizing.

If a node genuinely lacks a detail you need, ask for a more specific node, and
if it still lacks it, read the source — at the exact file:line the node points
to, not the whole file. Reading whole source files to build understanding is
the thing graft exists to replace.
