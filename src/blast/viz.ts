/**
 * The blast radius as a graph the viewer can draw — the hosted half of the PR
 * comment.
 *
 * The comment can hold about five circles before it stops being readable, and it
 * can never answer the reviewer's next question: which symbols, at which lines.
 * `graft viz --export` already produces a self-contained page, but its Context tab
 * is assembled from the deep tier's concept files, which the PR path deliberately
 * no longer builds — so on a structural build that tab held a single INDEX dot.
 *
 * This closes that gap with no new data and no LLM pass: `blast` has already
 * clustered both sides of the diff and named them (cached, one call), so the same
 * report is emitted here as {@link VizGraph} — amber node per changed area, blue
 * node per affected area, one edge per attribution the walk actually recorded. The
 * comment becomes a summary of this page rather than a separate computation.
