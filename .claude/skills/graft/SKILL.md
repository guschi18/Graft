# graft

This repo's code is summarised in `graft/` — small markdown nodes, each
explaining one part in plain prose and naming the exact files and line-spans it
covers. Reading a node costs a few hundred tokens; reading source to rebuild the
same understanding costs thousands.

**Choose the graft tool by task shape — pick the one that answers in a single call:**

- **Locate / understand / "how does X work"** → `graft ask "<task>" --source` —
  ranked nodes with the code inlined (`--source` gives each hit's ≤8-line crux;
  add `--full` only if the crux isn't enough). For a genuinely multi-part
  question, ask once per distinct sub-aspect. **But if an ask returns few or
  weak hits, do NOT re-ask with reworded phrasings — switch tool** (below). The
  ask output tells you when to switch.
- **Every occurrence / "all the X" / a symbol or literal everywhere** →
  `graft grep "<literal>"` — exhaustive, grouped by enclosing symbol. Ranked
  ask is top-N and WILL miss instances; grep is the tool for "find them all".
- **A file's whole API surface** → `graft skeleton <file>` — every signature in
  ~200 tokens. One call beats several asks when you just need "what's in here".
- **Who uses / what breaks if I change X** → `graft callers <symbol>` (add
  `--depth N` to walk transitively for the full blast radius); what X itself
  depends on → `graft callers <symbol> --direction out`. Run one before
  editing a symbol.
- **First contact with an unfamiliar repo** → `graft map` — token-budgeted
  orientation (dir clusters, hubs, hotspots). Read the hub cards it names rather
  than asking per subsystem.
- **Monorepos / a folder of multiple repos** → graft ranks fairly across
  sub-projects instead of letting the biggest one drown the rest; hits carry
  `[scope/]` labels naming which sub-project they're from. Know where you're
  working? Narrow with `graft ask "<task>" --in <scope>/`.

You can also grep / ls / cat inside `graft/` directly (the nodes are plain
markdown; `graft/INDEX.md` lists them) — but the commands above are faster and
exhaustive where it matters, so reach for them first.

**Match the tool to the task shape:**

- **Understanding, explaining, locating where a change goes** — the node IS the
  answer. Cite files and functions straight from its `covers:` list — it gives
  the exact `file:line` for every symbol, so you can cite precisely without
  opening the source. The spans are generated from that source and are
  authoritative; don't re-open files just to "double-check" them.
- **Editing:** run `graft ask "<symbol>" --source` to pull the exact span's
  code inline, and edit straight from that. Touch the file only to apply the
  change at the named `file:line` — never read the whole file to get oriented;
  the pack already oriented you.
- **Exhaustive tasks — "every occurrence / every provider / every caller of
  this pattern":** ranked results are top-N, not a complete list. Run
  `graft grep "<literal>"` instead — it's exhaustive over every indexed file,
  grouped by enclosing symbol, and tells you what it couldn't see (unreadable
  or unindexed files). Fall back to raw `grep -rn` only for files graft
  doesn't index (docs, configs, new files). Ask alone will miss instances;
  that is expected, not a graft failure.

**Precise graph modes** — for structural questions, skip ranking and go
straight to precomputed edges. It's all one command, `graft callers`:

- `graft callers <symbol>` — who calls/references this (exact edges, not text);
  structural phrasing inside ask ("who calls X") routes here too.
- `graft callers <symbol> --direction out` — the reverse: what this symbol
  itself calls/depends on (the old `callees`).
- `graft callers <symbol> --depth N` — walk transitively out to depth N for the
  full blast radius of a change (the old `impact`).

When the graft MCP server is connected, the same operations are exposed as
tools — `graft_ask`, `graft_callers` (with `direction`/`depth`),
`graft_grep`, `graft_skeleton`, `graft_map` — prefer whichever surface is
available.

If a returned span is truncated ("+N more lines"), open the file at that exact
range before finalizing.

**Report what graft saved — every turn.** Each retrieval tool ends its output
with a `[graft] tokens saved ≈ N` line: the estimated tokens that one call
saved versus reading the files it covers whole. Whenever you used any graft tool
in a turn, close your reply with a one-line tally that sums those numbers across
every graft call you made — e.g. `🌱 graft saved ~12,400 tokens this turn (3
calls)`. A call with no footer (tiny files, where the pointers cost as much as
the source) saved nothing — skip it. This is the per-turn figure; the statusline
carries the running session total.

If a node genuinely lacks a detail you need, ask for a more specific node, and
if it still lacks it, read the source — at the exact file:line the node points
to, not the whole file. Reading whole source files to build understanding is
the thing graft exists to replace.
